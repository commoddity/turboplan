# /task-1-plan — Plan one atomic MVP task

You refine **one** task file under `planning/phases/` so a **lesser / cheaper
agent** can run `/task-2-execute` next without rediscovering the design. Prefer
running this skill on a **large / expensive** model. You do **not** implement
product code unless the user explicitly asks.

## Arguments

- Task id: `T01` … `Tnn` (or path like `planning/phases/T03-….md`)  
- If omitted: read `planning/phases/INDEX.md`, pick the first `Pending`/`Planned`
  task whose Depends-on is `✅` / `Done` / `—`.

## Hard constraints (never violate in the plan)

<!-- BOOTSTRAP: replace this block with product-specific constraints. -->

1. Follow `.cursor/rules/general.mdc` — including **Karpathy Behavioral Guidelines**
   (think / simplicity / surgical / goal-driven) and domain spokes.  
2. Stay inside this task’s Acceptance Criteria — no gold plating (Simplicity First).  
3. Execution plan steps must use `→ verify:` pairs (Goal-Driven Execution).  
4. **Handoff fidelity:** the plan must be technically detailed enough for a
   smaller execute model (see hub “Model split”). Vague plans are not done.  
5. Prefer verification commands already used in the hub (`make verify`, tests, etc.).
   Plans must include **lint + test** gates and **tests for new code**.  
6. Study references listed in the stub; **reimplement** — do not vendor forbidden trees.  
7. Respect the project’s stack, platform, and packaging decisions as stated in the hub
   Architecture section. Do not silently switch languages, frameworks, or toolchains.  
8. If the task is ambiguous, stop and ask (Think Before Coding) — do not silently pick.  
9. If this task is *exceptionally* hard even with a detailed plan, add
   **`Execute model recommendation: large`** with a one-line why; otherwise omit
   (default = small/cheap execute is fine).  

## Procedure

### 1. Load context

- Read `planning/phases/INDEX.md`  
- Read the target task file end-to-end  
- Read depends-on task’s **Learnings** / **Verification** if `✅` / `Done`  
- Skim `.cursor/rules/general.mdc` + matching domain rules  
- Inspect the **current** repo tree  

### 2. Reality check

List what exists vs what the task assumes. Update Implementation notes / AC if
the codebase diverged. Record **Reality notes** if upstream task-3-complete left any.

### 3. Write execution plan into the task file

Write for a **junior / smaller-model executor**: no implied context.

```markdown
## Execution plan (filled by /task-1-plan)

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Codebase snapshot:** …
**Execute model:** small/default | large (only if justified below)

### Context for executor
- Goal in one paragraph
- Key files/packages involved (paths)
- Invariants from rules that apply

### Steps
1. … (concrete edit/create) → verify: …
2. … → verify: …

### Tests to add
- Table cases / scenarios …

### Verify commands
- …

### Risks / pitfalls
- …

### Out of scope
- …

### Execute model recommendation
- default (small/cheap) | large — rationale: …
```

Set Status to `Planned` only when a lesser agent could follow the plan cold.
Append Status History row.

### 4. Output to user

Ready? / Key steps / AC / Execute model: default|large / Next: `/task-2-execute TXX`

## Do not

- Implement the task  
- Expand scope into later layers  
- Mark INDEX `✅`  
- Leave a hand-wavy plan that forces the execute model to re-design
