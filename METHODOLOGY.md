## 🔥 The problem this solves

Long-horizon projects fail with coding agents when:

- 🏚️ Rules describe a **different product** than the one being built (stale fork residue)
- 🌀 Work is one giant prompt instead of **ordered, verifiable layers**
- 🕳️ There is no **close-out ritual** (learnings → rules, INDEX update, next task, downstream sync)

Turboplan is a **portable operating system** for agents: adapt rules to the goal, slice the goal into phases, and loop plan → execute → complete until done.

## 🏛️ Three pillars

### 1. 🧭 Adapt generic cross-compatible agent rules/skills to a specific goal

**Hub → spoke**

| Layer | File | Role |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| Hub (always on) | `.cursor/rules/general.mdc` | Karpathy guidelines, routing, safety, Rule Maintenance (dialectic 0–7), skills inventory, product architecture |
| Spokes (on demand) | `.cursor/rules/<domain>.mdc` | Failure modes and conventions for one domain (API, UI, packaging, …) |
| Skills (commands) | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Procedures: bootstrap, plan, execute, complete, dialectic, audit |

**Cross-compatible layout**

- Cursor loads `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (`alwaysApply` / globs)
- Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md` → **symlink** to `.cursor/rules/general.mdc`
- **Never** duplicate rules under `.claude/rules/`

**Adaptation protocol (when dropping into a project)**

1. State the goal in one paragraph + non-goals  
2. List domains you will touch (languages, frameworks, external APIs, platforms)  
3. **Delete** spokes/skills that cannot apply  
4. **Keep** Karpathy Behavioral Guidelines + Cross-Cutting Engineering Standards (incl. latest-stable toolchain, complete push + manual test) + Rule Maintenance 0–7 at full fidelity; keep hub→spoke, verification rails  
5. **Rewrite** architecture, routing map, build/verify commands, safety no-gos  
6. **Create** new spokes for novel domains (symptom / cause / fix tables)  
7. **Create dependency/docs spokes** for every named library/framework/API (official
   docs URL + best-practice rules); mirror a short summary in human `README.md`  
8. Point skills’ hard constraints at *this* product (not a previous fork)  
9. Bootstrap must leave a **git repo + verify gate** (root `Makefile` `verify` =
   lint+test[+build], stack lint config, **lefthook** pre-commit→verify, hooks installed).
   For **Go**: Makefile also includes multi-platform `build-all`. Seeds under
   `templates/seeds/` → `planning/*-SEED*`; bootstrap adapts to **repo root**.  
10. Prefer **latest stable** Go and package baselines; document pins as concerns  
11. Bootstrap must create/update root **`README.md`** (emoji headers + ASCII banner + Summary + TOC) for humans; rules/skills remain for agents — keep both in sync as the project evolves  
12. Bootstrap must create/update **`.gitignore`** (always `.env`/variants + `tmp/`; stack-aware binaries/artifacts — agent best judgment; merge if pre-existing)  
13. Create dependency/docs spokes for named libs (official docs URL) and mirror in README 

Use `/bootstrap-turboplan` (template skill) so an agent does this systematically from your goal text.  
Install templates first with [`scripts/install-into.sh`](scripts/install-into.sh).

### 2. 📋 Layered `planning/phases/INDEX.md` + stubs

**Why layers:** ship capability in dependency order. Do not start a higher layer until the lower one is verified.

Example layer sequence (generic):

```
L0  🏗️  Skeleton / config / logging
L1  🔐  Secrets / identity
L2  🧪  Core domain logic (pure, testable)
L3  🔌  Integration surface (HTTP, CLI, DB)
L4  🌐  Side systems (tunnels, third-party sync)
L5  🖥️  Operator UX (doctor, status, usage)
L6  🏁  End-to-end proof
```

**INDEX** is the single source of truth for task order:

| Column | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| ID | `T01` … `Tnn` |
| Title | Short name + link to stub file |
| Status | `Pending` → `Planned` → `InProgress` → `✅` / `Blocked` |
| Depends-on | Prior task IDs or `—` |
| Next | Following task ID |
| Layer | Which capability layer this advances |

**Stubs** are real markdown files (`T01-….md`) with: Description, Status History, Requirements, Implementation Plan (filled by `/task-1-plan`), Test Plan, Acceptance Criteria, Verification, Files Modified, Learnings, Next.

**Rules of granularity**

- One stub = one cohesive, independently verifiable unit  
- Prefer “prove this layer” over “build half the app”  
- No gold plating: out-of-scope ideas become **new** tasks, not silent scope creep  

### 3. 🔁 Skills that plan, execute, and complete in order

| Skill | When | Does |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| `/bootstrap-turboplan` | New project / retarget | From goal → rules + INDEX + stubs + dep spokes + human README + `.gitignore` + **root verify gate** (Makefile / lefthook / lint; Go: `build-all`) |
| `/task-1-plan TXX` | Before coding (prefer **large** model) | Reality-check; write handoff-ready plan for a lesser execute agent; Status → `Planned` |
| `/task-2-execute TXX` | After plan (prefer **small/cheap** model) | Follow plan until AC pass; **presence abort** then `make verify`; **do not** mark INDEX ✅ |
| `/task-3-complete TXX` | After execute (usually **small** model) | Same presence abort + re-verify; dialectic; sync stubs; INDEX → `✅`; commit; **push** (default; `--no-push` to skip); **Manual test** handoff; next branch |
| `/dialectic-of-cognition` | End of hard sessions / via `/task-3-complete` | Particular → general → encode into spokes |
| `/audit-rules` | Periodically | Read-only mechanical audit of rules/skills vs tree |

**Sequential contract**

```text
/bootstrap-turboplan   (once)     🧰  (prefer large)
        ↓
/task-1-plan T01                  📝  large → handoff-ready plan
        ↓
/task-2-execute T01               🛠️  small/cheap (or large if plan says so)
        ↓
/task-3-complete T01              ✅  usually small → push (default) + Manual test → branch <T02-stub-stem>
        ↓
/task-1-plan T02
        …
```

**Handoff rule:** if a smaller execute model would have to invent design, the plan
is not done — re-run `/task-1-plan` on a large model.

Only **one** phase task `InProgress` unless the human says otherwise.  

### 🧠 Context gathering (what the agent needs before bootstrapping)

Bootstrap and `/setup-tasks` share a context-gathering pattern. Before building
anything, the agent must extract from the human:

1. **Goal** — what users get when done (1–3 paragraphs). End-user perspective.
2. **Technical scope** — language, runtime, OS targets, packaging strategy, secrets
   policy. Be specific: "Go 1.26+, macOS/Linux host CLI, not Docker-primary."
3. **Non-goals** — explicit exclusions that prevent scope creep
4. **Dependencies** — named libraries, frameworks, external APIs. Each becomes a
   rules spoke with canonical docs URL
5. **Layer preference** (optional) — if the human already knows the build order
6. **References** — code or docs to study (reimplement, do not vendor)

**Why this matters:** without this upfront, the agent invents constraints that
the human then has to correct at review time — wasting both sides. The bootstrap
skill must refuse to proceed if goal/constraints are missing.

### 🔁 Pre-planning with `/setup-tasks`

For an **existing** Turboplan project (already bootstrapped), adding a new
feature or subsystem uses `/setup-tasks` instead of re-running bootstrap:

- Gathers context (same pattern as bootstrap: goal, constraints, dependencies)
- Reads current INDEX and rules to understand the existing architecture
- Proposes new `planning/phases/TXX-….md` stubs appended to INDEX
- Does NOT rewrite rules, skills, or README — only adds tasks

**Overlap with bootstrap:** the context-gathering questions are identical. The
difference is scope: bootstrap re-architects the whole repo; `/setup-tasks` adds
tasks to an existing plan without disturbing rules or completed work.

### 🔁 Running the loop

After bootstrap or `/setup-tasks`, the work loop is:

```text
/task-1-plan T01                  📝  large model → handoff-ready plan
/task-2-execute T01               🛠️  small/cheap model (or large if plan says so)
/task-3-complete T01              ✅  small model → push (default) + Manual test → branch <T02-stub-stem>
```

**Model split:**

| Skill | Typical model | Why |
| ----- | ------------- | --- |
| `/task-1-plan` | Large / expensive | Design, tradeoffs, handoff fidelity |
| `/task-2-execute` | Small / fast / cheap | Follow a concrete plan + verify |
| `/task-3-complete` | Small / cheap | Re-verify, dialectic, commit, push, next branch |

**Plan bar:** `/task-1-plan` must be detailed enough that a lesser agent can
execute without redesigning (paths, steps → verify, tests, commands, pitfalls).

**Branching:** work on `<stub-stem>` (e.g. `T04-sanitizer-adapter`). After
complete, push and switch to next stub-stem branch. Never commit on `main`/`master`.
Never force-push.

**Blocked tasks:** set Status `Blocked` with reason. Do not complete or mark
INDEX ✅. Human decides: replan, split, or change requirements.

**Granularity heuristics:**

| Too big | Too small | Just right |
| ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| "Build the app" | "Rename one variable" | "Sanitizer maps aliases + unit tests" |
| "All networking" | "Add one log line" | "Tunnel supervisor + URL parse + restart" |

Each task must answer: **How do we know this layer works without the next layer?**

## 🌱 Rule maintenance (self-evolving)

**Source of truth:** installed project’s `.cursor/rules/general.mdc` → section
**Rule Maintenance (Self-Evolving Rules)** (triggers, abort gate, steps **0–7**).
Do not maintain a shortened competing copy here.

**Harness:** `/dialectic-of-cognition` (Modes A/B for project rules).

Summary (full detail lives in the hub template):

1. **Abort gate** — one-sentence test without file/function names  
2. **Particular → general** — problem *class*, not instance  
3. **Encode** — symptom / cause / fix tables + `last-verified`  
4. **Verify** — cold-read recognition  
5. **Contradictions / dedupe / decay / 600-line split**  

---

## 🧭 Karpathy Behavioral Guidelines (always in hub)

**Source of truth:** `templates/rules/general.mdc` (and the installed project’s
copy) — section **Karpathy Behavioral Guidelines**, full four parts.

Do **not** paraphrase into a shorter bullet list in other docs — that loses
fidelity. Agents must read the hub.

| # | Name | Core idea |
| - | ---- | --------- |
| 1 | Think Before Coding | Assumptions, tradeoffs, ask when unclear |
| 2 | Simplicity First | Minimum code; no speculative flexibility |
| 3 | Surgical Changes | Touch only what’s required; clean only your orphans |
| 4 | Goal-Driven Execution | Verifiable success criteria; step → verify loops |

**Tradeoff:** bias caution over speed; use judgment on trivial tasks.

## 🧱 Cross-cutting engineering standards (always in hub)

**Source of truth:** same hub → **Cross-Cutting Engineering Standards**.

| Topic | Default |
| ----- | ------- |
| Backend / server / CLI | **Go** (raise non-Go as bootstrap concern) |
| Static site | **Astro** |
| App-style UI | **Vue** |
| Desktop | **Wails** |
| Tests | Required with new code; Go → table-driven |
| Lint | Required; auto-fix first; fail only if unfixable |
| Git hooks | Repo + **Makefile verify** + lint config + **lefthook** pre-commit→verify (bootstrap AC) |
| Go Makefile | `lint` · `test` · `build` · `build-all` (cross) · `verify` (= lint+test+build) |
| Pack seeds | `templates/seeds/{readme,gitignore,verify}/` → `planning/*-SEED*` → root via bootstrap |
| Toolchain / deps | **Latest stable** Go + packages at bootstrap (concern if pinned older) |
| Execute / complete | Presence check + full lint+test(+build) verify before pass / ✅; abort if tooling missing |
| Complete push | `/task-3-complete` **pushes** by default; opt out with `--no-push` |
| Complete handoff | Close-out includes **Manual test** commands or `Nothing to test` + why |
| UX completeness | When adopting a UX convention across multiple user-facing artifacts (all CLI commands, all prompts), apply it uniformly in a **single sweep** — not incrementally across sessions |
| Display-id caution | User-facing labels that double as runtime identifiers create a risk surface — treat stable identifiers as defaults and label experimental ones clearly |

Adaptation protocol: when rewriting a hub for a product, **keep Karpathy,
Cross-Cutting Engineering Standards, and Rule Maintenance 0–7 verbatim**; only
replace product architecture, routing, and examples.

---

## 🚫 What Turboplan is not

- Not a replacement for human product judgment  
- Not automatic commits / pushes outside `/task-3-complete` (or explicit user ask). That skill commits and **pushes by default**; use `--no-push` to skip push  
- Not a requirement to use Docker, a specific UI framework, or a specific LLM vendor  
- Not permission to rewrite unrelated repo areas when capturing learnings elsewhere

- [ ] Root `.gitignore` covers secrets (`.env*`), `tmp/`, and stack artifacts (Go binaries, etc.)  
- [ ] Routing Map lists every spoke file that exists  
- [ ] No leftover rules for deleted tech stacks  
- [ ] `planning/phases/INDEX.md` has ordered tasks with Depends-on / Next  
- [ ] Every INDEX row has a stub file with AC and empty Execution plan section  
- [ ] Skills’ hard constraints match *this* product  
- [ ] First actionable task is clear: `/task-1-plan T01`
